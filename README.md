# Talk: Optimizing React Performance Practically

> Essential techniques and best practices for optimizing React performance, leveraging powerful profiling tools, and implementing strategies to deliver lightning-fast React web applications.

This project was used as a demo project for my talk at [Frontend Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/productboard-meetups/events/294061635) in Prague on June 20, 2023

I used it in the presentation for live coding and investigating/optimizing perf issues.

Technologies used: JavaScript, React, Material UI, YouTube V3 API
